    A Mulgara resolver and associated plugins for reacting to updates.

    <p>
    The purpose of the {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.FilterResolver FilterResolver}
    is to be get notifications whenever updates to a model are made. The FilterResolver is
    configured with a list of {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.FilterHandler
    FilterHandler}'s which get notified on updates. The two main handlers currently are the 
    {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.TransactionLogger TransactionLogger} and the
    {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.CacheInvalidator CacheInvalidator}. The
    TransactionLogger will log all inserts, deletes, model creates, and model drops to a log
    file which can be replayed to re-generate the db in case of a catastrophic failure. The
    CacheInvalidator is used to send out cache-invalidations when certain data are modified.
    </p>
    <p>
    Lastly there is the {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.FedoraUpdater FedoraUpdater}
    and its associated {@link org.topazproject.mulgara.resolver.UpdateFilter UpdateFilter}'s.
    This is legacy code and was used to attempt to store triples back into Fedora, providing
    effectively the reverse of Fedora's resource-indexer. However, there are tricky
    race-conditions when both the resource-indexer and the FedoraUpdater are used, making this
    approach unusable.
