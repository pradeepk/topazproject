<h2>1. About <em>PLoS Genetics</em></h2>
<p>The techniques of genetics and genomics are being applied to a wealth of biological questions and experimental systems. <em>PLoS Genetics</em> reflects the full breadth and interdisciplinary nature of this research by publishing outstanding original contributions in all areas of biology. With immediate free access to all content, <em>PLoS Genetics</em> provides a unique venue for publishing genetics and genomics research, ensuring that authors reach the widest possible audience.</p>
 
<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> publishes human studies as well as research on model organisms from mice and flies, to plants and bacteria. Topics include (but are not limited to) gene discovery and function, population genetics, genome projects, comparative and functional genomics, genetics of disease and disease models, gene therapy, cancer biology, evolution, gene expression, complex traits, chromosome biology, and epigenetics. <em>PLoS Genetics</em> welcomes research articles that demonstrate a novel methodological advance.</p>

<a name="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>

<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLoS Genetics</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Originality</li>
<li>High importance to researchers in the field</li>
<li>Broad interest to researchers in genetics and genomics</li>
<li>Rigorous methodology</li>
<li>Substantial evidence for its conclusions</li>
</ul>

<p>Manuscripts also must be well written to ensure clear and effective presentation of the work and key findings. <p>

<h2>5. Writing the Review</h2>

<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such consultations have first been discussed with the AE.</p>

<a name="timely"></a>
<h2>7. Timely Review</h2>
<p><em>PLoS Genetics</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond promptly, usually within ten days of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the authors informed as appropriate.</p>
