<h1>About <em>${journal_name}</em></h1>

<p><em>PLoS Pathogens</em> (eISSN 1553-7374, ISSN 1553-7366) is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published monthly by the <a href="http://www.plos.org">Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS), a nonprofit organization.</p>

<p><em>PLoS Pathogens</em> is run by an international <a href="edboard.action">Editorial Board</a>, headed by the Editor-in-Chief, Kasturi Haldar (Northwestern University,
Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Bacteria, fungi, parasites, prions and viruses cause a plethora of diseases that have important medical, agricultural, and economic consequences. Moreover, the study of microbes continues to provide novel insights into such fundamental processes as the molecular basis of cellular and organismal function.</p>
 
<p><em>PLoS Pathogens</em> reflects the full breadth of research in these areas by publishing outstanding original articles that significantly advance the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their host organisms. Topics include (but are not limited to) adaptive and innate immune defenses as well as pathogen countermeasures, emerging pathogens, evolution, genomics and gene regulation, model host organisms, pathogen-cell biology, pathogenesis, prions, proteomics and signal transduction, rational vaccine design, structural biology, and virulence factors.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="guidelines.action">Author Guidelines</a> when you are preparing your manuscripts for submission. If you are unsure whether your paper is suitable for <em>PLoS Pathogens</em>, you can send a <a href="guidelines.action#presubs">Presubmission Inquiry</a>.</p>
