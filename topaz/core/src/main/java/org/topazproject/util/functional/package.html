    <p>A set of utilities to make functional programming easier.</p>
    <p>Functional programming requires closures, which will not be generally available until JDK 1.7. This package contains templates and methods which provide similar functionality to closures via "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object">functors</a>". Since functor syntax is quite verbose, the class and method names are intentionally terse, though hopefully with sensible mnemonics.</p>
    <p>Functions are represented by classes starting with the name "Fn". An optional "E" may follow, indicating that the function may throw an exception. Finally, a number at the end of the classname indicates that the number of arguments for the function.</p>
    <p>The interface templates are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>Fn</code> - Function taking no arguments and <em>will not</em> throw an exception.</li>
      <li><code>FnE</code> - Function taking no arguments and <em>may</em> throw an exception.</li>
      <li><code>Fn1</code> - Function taking 1 argument and <em>will not</em> throw an exception.</li>
      <li><code>Fn1E</code> - Function taking 1 argument and <em>may</em> throw an exception.</li>
      <li><code>Fn2</code> - Function taking 2 arguments and <em>will not</em> throw an exception.</li>
      <li><code>Fn2E</code> - Function taking 2 arguments and <em>may</em> throw an exception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <code>C</code> class represents methods for interacting with <em>Collections</em>. These include methods for traditional head/tail operations common in functional programs, and functional methods, such as <em>map</em> and <em>foreach</em>.</p>
    <p>The <code>F</code> class contains static methods for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a>. It will curry N argument functors to N-1 argument functors.</p>
