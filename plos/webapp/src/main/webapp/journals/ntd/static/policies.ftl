<h2>1. Copyright and License Policies</h2>
<p>Upon submission of an article, authors are asked to indicate their agreement to abide by an open-access license. The license permits any user to download, print out, extract, archive, and distribute the article, so long as appropriate credit is given to the authors and source of the work. The license ensures that your article will be as widely available as possible and that your article can be included in any scientific archive.</p>

<p>Upon publication, PLoS also deposits all articles in <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/" title="PubMed Central">PubMed Central</a>.  This complies with the policies of funding agencies, such as the <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/" title="NIH">NIH</a> in the USA, the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/node3302.html" title="Wellcome Trust">Wellcome Trust</a> and the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/" title="Research Councils in the UK">Research Councils</a> in the UK, and the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/news/information_science_research/other_news/info_wissenschaft_04_06.html" title="Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> in Germany, which request or require deposition of the published articles that they fund into publicly available databases.</p>

<p>Please read about the <a href="license.action" title="Creative Commons Attribution License">Creative Commons Attribution License</a> before submitting your paper.</p>


<a name="publication"></a>
<h2>2.  Publication Charges</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses&#8212;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&#8212;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> the publication fee is US$2100. Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html" title="PLoS.org | Institutional members">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We offer a complete or partial fee waiver for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment information, and hence inability to pay will not influence the decision to publish a paper.</p>


<a name="reviewer"></a>
<h2>3. Reviewer and Editor Exclusions</h2>
<p>Upon submission of a manuscript, authors will be asked if they wish to exclude any specific academic editors or reviewers from the peer review of their article. The editorial team will respect these requests so long as this does not interfere with the objective and thorough assessment of the article. See the relevant <a href="reviewerGuidelines.action" title="PLoS NTDs | Reviewer Guidelines">guidelines for reviewers</a> and more information on the <a href="competing.action" title="PLoS NTDs | Competing Interest Policy">policy of PLoS regarding competing interests</a>.</p>
  

<a name="sharing"></a>
<h2>4. Sharing of Materials, Methods, and Data</h2>

<p>Publication is conditional upon the agreement of authors to make freely available any materials and information associated <p>Publication is conditional upon the agreement of authors to make freely available any materials and information associated with their publication that are reasonably requested by others for the purpose of academic, noncommercial research.</p>

<h5>Data Availability</h5>

<p>Open access applies to both the scientific literature and the data used to establish that literature. Publication is contingent on making data integral to a manuscript freely available without restriction, provided that appropriate attribution is given and that suitable mechanisms exist for sharing the data used in a manuscript.</p>

<ol>
<li>Data for which public repositories have been established that are in general use should be deposited before publication, and the appropriate accession numbers or digital object identifiers published with the paper.</li>
<li>If an appropriate repository does not exist, data should be provided as supporting information with the published paper. If this is not practical, data should be made freely available upon reasonable request.</li>
<li>The conclusions of a study must not be dependent solely on the analysis of proprietary data. If proprietary data were used to reach a conclusion, and the authors are unwilling or unable to make these data public, then the paper must include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so that others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that any restrictions on the availability or on the use of datasets might be judged to diminish the significance of a paper and will therefore influence the decision about whether a paper should be published. These policies have been developed in accordance with the principles established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>

<h5>Software/Algorithm Sharing</h5>

<p>If new software or a new algorithm is central to a paper, the authors must provide sufficient information to allow interested users to reproduce and build on the authors' work. In cases where the software/algorithm is not central to the paper, we nevertheless encourage authors to make all relevant materials freely available. Software can be provided under license where necessary, but any restrictions on the availability or on the use of materials might be judged to diminish the significance of a paper and therefore might influence the decision about whether a paper should be published subject to those conditions. These policies have been developed in accordance with the principles established in <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309088593/html/" title="Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials (National Academies Press, 2003)"><em>Sharing Publication-Related Data and Materials</em></a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>


<a name="reporting"></a>
<h2>5. Reporting Guidelines for Specific Study Designs</h2>
<a name="clinical_trials"></a>
<h5>a. Clinical Trials</h5> 


<p>Authors must submit original protocols as supporting information to allow editors and reviewers to assess manuscripts fully. Any deviation from the protocol must be explained.</p>

<p>We require that authors of clinical trials adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design. Please check the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" title="CONSORT statement Web site">CONSORT statement Web site</a> for information on the appropriate guidelines for specific trial types. All reports of the results of randomized clinical trials should include the CONSORT flow diagram as Figure 1, and authors should complete and submit the checklist contained within the CONSORT statement. Information on statistical methods or participants beyond what is indicated in the CONSORT statement should be reported according to the specifications indicated in the Methods section under Preparation of Manuscripts (below).</p>

<p>PLoS supports the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) on trial registration. All trials initiated after 1 July 2005 must be registered prospectively in a publicly accessible registry (i.e., before patient recruitment has begun), or they will not be considered for publication. For trials initiated before 1 July 2005, all trials must be registered before submission to our journals. The trial's registration number must be provided at the time of submission. See the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq.pdf" title="ICMJE faq">ICMJE faq</a> on trial registration for further details.</p>

<a name="systematic_reviews"></a>
<h5>b. Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials</h5>

<p>Reports of meta-analyses of randomized controlled studies should use the QUOROM statement as a guide (Moher D, Cook DJ, Eastwood S, Olkin I, Rennie D, Stroup DF [1999] Improving the quality of reports of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials: The QUOROM statement. Lancet354: 1896–900), and should include a copy of the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/QUOROM.pdf" title="QUOROM checklist">QUOROM checklist</a>. 
</p> 

<a name="diagnostic_studies"></a>
<h5>c. Diagnostic Studies</h5>

<p>Reports of studies of diagnostic accuracy should conform to the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/stardstatement.htm" title="STARD requirements">STARD requirements</a>.</p>

<a name="epidemiological_studies"></a>
<h5>d. Epidemiological Studies</h5>

<p>For reports of epidemiological studies, you should consult the <a href="http://www.strobe-statement.org" title="STROBE initiative">STROBE initiative</a>.</p>

<a name="microarray_experiments"></a>
<h5>e. Microarray Experiments</h5>

<p>Reports of microarray experiments should conform to <a href="http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html" title="MIAME guidelines">the MIAME guidelines</a>, and the data from the experiments must be deposited in a publicly accessible database.</p>

<h3>Clinical Trials Manuscript Template</h3>

<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosclinicaltrials/Template.doc">Download</a> an MS Word (57 KB DOC) version of the clinical trials manuscript template.</p>
<p>The clinical trials manuscript template above will help to prepare your manuscript in the standard format. The template consists of the standard headings along with body text explaining what to include in each section. You should overwrite (or copy and paste) the body text with the corresponding section text for your article.</p>

<a name="studies"></a>
<h2>6. Publication of Studies Sponsored by Pharmaceutical Companies.</h2>
<p>We support the <a href="http://basic1.easily.co.uk/03100E/00605D/guidelines.htm" title="Good Publication Practice guidelines for pharmaceutical companies">guidelines for the reporting of studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies</a>.</p>

<a name="human"></a>
<h2>7. Human and Animal Research</h2>
<p>All research involving humans and animals must have been approved by the authors' institutional review board or equivalent committee and that board named by the authors. In the case of human participants, informed consent must have been obtained and all clinical investigation must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm" title="World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki | Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects">Declaration of Helsinki</a>.  Authors should submit a statement from the ethics committee or institutional review board indicating their approval of the research. We also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent form and may require submission of completed forms on particular occasions.</p>

<a name="nomenclature"></a>
<h2>8. Nomenclature</h2>
<p>The use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>We strongly encourage the use of <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/" title="BIPM | The International System of Units (SI)">SI units</a>. If you do not use these exclusively, please provide the SI value in parentheses after each value.</li>

<li>Species names should be italicized (e.g., <em>Homo sapiens</em>).</li>
<li>Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., <a href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/" title="HGNC | HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee">HUGO</a>. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or cellular localization should be shown in roman: v-fes, c-MYC, etc.</li>
<li>The Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN) of drugs should be provided.</li>
</ul>


<a name="prior"></a>
<h2>9. Submission of Related Manuscripts</h2>
<p>When submitting an article, all authors are asked to indicate that they have not submitted a similar manuscript for publication elsewhere. If related work has been submitted elsewhere, then a copy must be included with the article submitted to PLoS. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions.</p>

<a name="author"></a>
<h2>10. Author Status</h2>
<p><em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> follows the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors on authorship, and authors should make sure they are familiar with these <a href="http://www.icmje.org" title="ICMJE: Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication">guidelines</a>. All authors will be contacted via e-mail at submission by the <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> editorial office to indicate that they are aware of and approve the submission to <em>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em> of the manuscript, its content, authorship, and order of authorship. No decision can be made on an article until all authors have provided their assent to publication. The involvement of any professional medical writer in publication must be declared. We encourage authors to consult the <a href="http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf" title="EMWA guidelines on the role of medical writers in developing peer-reviewed publications (PDF)">European Medical Writers' Association Guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers. </p>

<a name="competing"></a>
<h2>11. Competing Interests</h2>
<p>Authors are asked at submission to declare whether they have any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced their paper. Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. <a href="competing.action" title="PLoS policy regarding competing interests">Click here for more general information on the Public Library of Science's policy regarding competing interests.</a></p> 

<a name="scientific"></a>
<h2>12. Scientific and Editorial Misconduct</h2>
<p>Scientific misconduct is defined by the <a href="http://ori.dhhs.gov/" title="Office of Research Integrity">Office of Research Integrity</a> as "fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research." In cases where there is a suspicion or allegation of scientific misconduct or fraudulent research in manuscripts submitted for review, PLoS reserves the right to pass along these manuscripts to the sponsoring or funding institution or other appropriate authority for investigation. Although PLoS recognizes its responsibility to ensure that the suspicion of misconduct has been addressed, we do not ourselves make such determinations. PLoS is also represented at the <a href="http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/" title="Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> and will abide by its principles and rulings.</p>

<a name="corrections"></a>
<h2>13. Corrections and Additions</h2>
<p>Corrections to articles will be considered for publication if the correction is judged by the editors to affect seriously the interpretation of the work and if all authors of the original publication have approved the correction. In cases of a dispute, authors should contact the editors. Authors should send corrections directly to the journal editorial staff.</p>

<a name="confidentiality"></a>
<h2>14. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Editors and reviewers are requested to treat all submitted manuscripts in strict confidence.</p>

<a name="anonymity"></a>
<h2>15. Author Anonymity/Double Blind Review</h2>
<p>Authors have the option during submission to request that their identities are not revealed to reviewers&#8212;if the manuscript is sent for external peer review. If this option is chosen. authors are responsible for stripping identifying information from their uploaded files. Please be advised that author and institution information may be encoded within the properties associated with the manuscript file. PLoS cannot be held responsible if reviewers are able to identify authors.</p>


<a name="embargoes"></a>
<h2>16. Blogs, Wikis, Embargoes, and the Media</h2>
<p>Authors are of course at liberty to present and discuss their findings ahead of publication: at medical or scientific conferences, on preprint servers, and in blogs, wikis and other informal communication channels. We recommend, however, that authors do not contact the media or respond to such contact unless an article has been accepted for publication and an embargo date has been established. Respect for press embargoes will help to ensure that your work is reported accurately in the popular media, and that the full peer-reviewed paper is freely available to any interested reader when the news item is published. If a journalist has covered a piece of work ahead of publication, this will not affect consideration of the work for publication. See also our <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/embargopolicy.html" title="PLoS.org | Embargo Guidelines">embargo guidelines for journalists</a>.</p>
