<p class="intro">As part of the process of making scientific and medical literature freely available on the Web, PLoS uses a streamlined production process that takes authors' figures straight to layout. We appreciate every effort authors put toward ensuring that their figures meet our specifications.</p>

<p>The figures that appear with the online version of articles are provided at the highest quality possible, so authors should submit their figures properly sized, with fonts and labels at an appropriate size, and produced in a high-resolution format. The  following steps will help you meet these criteria; please read them carefully. A summary of figure requirements follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Color: RGB or Grayscale</li>
	<li>Dimensions: Width 9 cm-18 cm (or ~3.5 in-7 in), Height 1 cm-24 cm (or ~0.5 in-9.5 in)</li>
	<li>Text: Arial font, between 6 and 12 points</li>
	<li>Format: TIFF or EPS (TIFF preferred)</li>
	<li>Resolution (for TIFF): 600 dpi</li>
	<li>Size: 10MB or less</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER</strong><br />
 Simply because a figure looks good on screen, this does not mean it is at an optimal resolution. For reassurance, size figure to intended dimensions, and double-check your specifications or print the image on your personal printer. The online version should look relatively similar to the home-printer copy.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Select Color Mode</h2>
<p>Your images should be in either RGB or grayscale. Please adjust your color settings before beginning your work.</p>

<a name="dimensions" id="dimensions"></a>
<h2>Step 2: Choose Figure Dimensions</h2>
<p>After removing all excess white space, figures should have a width between 9 cm and 18 cm. Figures cannot have a height of more than  24 cm. </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Width: 9 cm&#8211;18 cm (or ~3.5 in&#8211;7 in)</li>
    <li>Height: 1 cm&#8211;24 cm (or ~0.5 in&#8211;9.5 in)</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>All figures will be left-aligned on the page or column, so please design accordingly.</p>

<a name="text" id="text"></a>
<h2>Step 3: Choose Figure Text</h2>

<p>Label your figure panels with in Arial <strong>bold</strong> font, 12 point, with  capital letters. Do NOT use any punctuation (no periods or brackets)!  All other figure text must be in Arial font, between 6 and 10 points.</p>

<p><strong>Always embed fonts when using vector file types (EPS format).</strong> Special symbols and  Greek characters will not reproduce properly unless you embed the fonts.</p>

<a name="format" id="format"></a>
<h2>Step 4. Choose File Format/Resolution/Size</h2>

<p>TIFF is the preferred format for figures. Currently we accept figures in either TIFF or EPS format; however, authors should note that EPS files will be automatically converted to TIFF prior to publication. </p>

<p>TIFF files must have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi. Any images placed within EPS files must be at least 300 dpi. </p>

<p>Please remember that the quality of your figures will only be as good as the lowest-resolution element placed in them. In other words, if you use a 72 dpi line graph and make it a 600 dpi TIFF, the image will still print out as a 72 dpi image. The figure should not look fuzzy, jagged, pixilated, or grainy at intended print size. </p>

<p>Each figure (including all supporting figures) should be under 10 MB to optimize online accessibility.</p>

<p>If your figure is assembled from multiple images, please embed images, group objects or flatten layers, and flatten transparencies.</p>

<p>When saving as TIFF files, please choose compression option LZW (this will greatly reduce file size while retaining quality). Some programs may downsample your images to low resolution. Do not use the "optimize for web" wizard in PowerPoint or PhotoShop for any figures.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Upload Audio, Video, and Motion Graphics</h2>

<p>We encourage authors to submit multimedia files that are crucial to  the conclusions of the paper. Multimedia files should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in  loading or downloading files. Preferred formats are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Audio: MP3</li>
	<li>Video: MOV, progressive download,  320x240px frame size</li>
	<li>Flash: SWF</li>
</ul>

<a name="tables" id="tables"></a>
<h2>Step 6: Format Tables</h2>

<p>Tables should be included in the text file, at the very end of the manuscript. The table title should be concise, no more than one sentence. The rest of the table legend and any footnotes should be placed below the table. Footnotes can be used to explain abbreviations. </p>

<p>Tables must be cell-based, such as would be produced in a spreadsheet program or in Microsoft Word. These should be pasted into the manuscript file as such. Do not provide tables as graphic objects. Tables must be no larger than one printed page (7inches x 9.5inches). Larger tables can be published as online supporting information. Bold and italics formatting will be preserved in the published version; however, more extensive formatting will be lost.  Do not include color, shading, lines, rules, text boxes, tabs, returns, or pictures within the table.</p>

<p>Multi-part tables with varying numbers of columns or multiple footnote sections should be divided and renumbered as separate tables.</p>

	<tr>

		<td><strong><em><p>Example of acceptable subheads within a table</strong></em></p></td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
