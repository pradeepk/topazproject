<div id="content" class="static"><h1>LaTeX Guidelines</h1>


<p>Authors who have prepared their manuscripts using LaTeX may upload the file in PDF format for use during the review process. If the article is accepted for publication, the .tex files and formatting information will be required as a zipped file. Please find full instructions below.</p>

<h2>Initial Submission</h2>

<p>Please upload your initial submission in PDF form. Use simple formatting and a minimum of special features to ease the production process. Include your tables at the end of the manuscript text, as per our <a href="guidelines.action">Author Guidelines</a>. Only this file, containing your manuscript text, references, figure legends and tables, will be asked for in its .tex form; all other files should follow our Author Guidelines exactly. Supporting Information files prepared in LaTeX should be submitted as PDFs and will be published as such. Figures should be submitted as separate files in TIFF or EPS format; figure captions should appear at the end of the article file. Do not refer to sections of your manuscript by the LaTeX numbered headings; all articles will be produced to conform to PLoS style and these numbers will be removed. </p>

<h2>On Acceptance</h2> 

<p>On acceptance, you will be asked to upload your .tex files and formatting information as a zipped file. Please upload this as a new file; do not replace your PDF article file. Upload this as a new Supporting Information zipped file in either .zip or .tar.gz format. Your published article will be produced from the .tex files, so please ensure all revisions or changes are included in the .tex file.</p>

<p>In this zipped file, please include:</p>
