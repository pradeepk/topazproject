<h2>Scope</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> features reports of primary research from all disciplines within science and medicine. By not excluding papers on the basis of subject area, <em>PLoS ONE</em> facilitates the discovery of the connections between papers whether within or between disciplines. </p>

<h2>Peer Review</h2>
<p>Each submission will be assessed by a member of the <em>PLoS ONE</em> Editorial Board before publication. This pre-publication peer review will concentrate on technical rather than subjective concerns and may involve discussion with other members of the Editorial Board and/or the solicitation of formal reports from independent referees. If published, papers will be made available for community-based open peer review involving online annotation, discussion, and rating. </p>

<h2>Open Access</h2>

<h2>Publication Charges</h2>

<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses&#8212;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&#8212;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLoS ONE</em> the publication fee is US$1250.  Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html" title="PLoS.org | Institutional Members">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We offer a complete or partial fee waiver for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment information, and hence inability to pay will not influence the decision to publish a paper.</p>
