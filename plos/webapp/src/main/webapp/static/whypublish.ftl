<h1>Why Publish in <em>PLoS ONE</em>?</h1>

<h2>Widely disseminated and cited results&#8212;with no access restrictions!</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.plos.org/oa/index.html" title="PLoS.org | Open Access">Open access</a> means that your work will always be freely available to the world from our Web site and from PubMed Central. And open access translates into <a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157" title="PLoS Biology | Citation Advantage of Open Access Articles by Gunther Eysenbach">greater usage and more citations</a>.</p>

<h2>Results published FAST</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> couples efficient and objective peer review with a streamlined electronic production workflow.</p>

<h2>Technically based publication decisions</h2>
<p>Too often a journal's decision to publish a paper is dominated by subjective criteria, which can be frustrating and delay the publication of your work. <em>PLoS ONE</em> will publish all papers that are judged to be rigorous and technically sound. Judgments about the importance of any particular paper are then made after publication.</p>

<h2>Start of a conversation</h2>
<p>Papers published in <em>PLoS ONE</em> will be available for commenting and debate by the readers, making every paper the start of a scientific conversation.</p>

<h2>Inclusive scope</h2>
<p>Most conventional journals publish papers from tightly defined subject areas, making it more difficult for readers from other disciplines to read them. <em>PLoS ONE</em> has no such barriers, which helps your research reach the entire scientific community.</p>
