  <div class="figure-popup-description">
    <p>(A) FISH for <em>Xic</em> genomic sequences (red) demonstrates the three classes of signals in PFA-fixed female ES cells. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue).</p>
    <p>(B) ES cells display an elevated proportion of SD signals at X-chromosomal loci. Average data from two to four experiments (<em>n</em> &gt; 150), scored by two independent scorers, are presented. Error bars indicate one standard deviation. See <a href="#JOURNAL-PBIO-0040159-SG001">Figure S1</a>A for complete scoring of SS, SD, and DD signals in these cells.</p>
