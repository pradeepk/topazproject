  <p class="intro">PLoS wants to publish your clinical trials research!</p>

  <p>PLoS Hubs collect together research from across many open-access journals, and do not accept
  submissions directly. You should continue to submit your work to the PLoS journal that best
  suits your needs. If you submit your clinical trials article to
  <a href="http://www.plosone.org/" title="PLoS ONE"><em>PLoS ONE</em></a> it will automatically
  appear, upon publication, in the PLoS Hub for Clinical Trials. If you submit your work to another
  PLoS journal a link to the paper will be provided on the PLoS Hub homepage, and the article will
  be fully incorporated into the PLoS Hub in the coming months. </p>

  <p>
    All PLoS journals are open-access, so whichever journal you choose, anyone interested in your
    work will be able to <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/creativeuses.html" title="PLoS.org | Creative Uses">find it,
    read it, print it, distribute it, and build on it</a>.
