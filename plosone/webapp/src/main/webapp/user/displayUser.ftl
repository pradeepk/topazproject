<li><span class="heading">About Me</span><span class="text">I am a researcher and Web Designer at the University of San Francisco. In our lab we attempted a similar experiment but the set up was much easier. We used simpler equipments, half as many control groups and it took approximately half the time to produce similar results. I have to qualify that and say that the results are still being reviewed, but so far it looks very promising.</span></li>
