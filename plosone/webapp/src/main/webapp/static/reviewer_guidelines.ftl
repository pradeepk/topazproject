<h2><a name="about" id="about">1. About <em>PLoS ONE</em></a></h2>
<p>Scientific progress requires the exchange and  discussion of data and ideas. <em>PLoS ONE</em> is  a unique publication dedicated to presenting the results of scientific research  from any scientific or medical discipline in an open-access environment. At the same time,  it provides a forum in which to discuss that research and so provide  for each and every paper its maximum possible impact. To achieve this, <em>PLoS ONE</em> employs a two-stage assessment  process. Pre-publication peer review concentrates on objective and technical  concerns to determine whether the research has been sufficiently well  conceived, well executed, and well described to justify inclusion in the  scientific record. Post-publication, papers are opened up for interactive  discussions and assessment in which the whole scientific community can be  involved. </p>

<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses&#8212;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&#8212;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLoS ONE</em> the publication fee is US$1250.  Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html" title="PLoS.org | Institutional Members">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We also have a fee waiver policy for authors who do not have funds to cover  publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment  information, and hence ability to pay will not influence publication decisions.  These policies ensure that the fee is never a barrier to publication.</p>

  
<h2><a name="criteria" id="criteria">2. Criteria for Publication</a></h2>
<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLoS ONE</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Results reported have not been published elsewhere. </li>
  <li>Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard. </li>
  <li>Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion. </li>

  <li>Techniques used have been documented in sufficient detail to allow replication.</li>
  <li>Reports are presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="process" id="process"></a>3. Overview of the Editorial Process</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> will provide all authors  with an efficient and "hassle-free" editorial process. Our aim is to identify  those submissions that warrant inclusion in the scientific record and present  them to the scientific community with as few hurdles as possible. </p>
  <p>The editorial process is run by its extensive <a href="edboard.action" title="PLoS ONE | Advisory and Editorial Boards">board of academic editors</a> (AEs). AEs are invited to handle submitted manuscripts based  upon the content of the manuscript. The AE evaluates the paper and decides  whether it describes a body of work that meets the editorial criteria of <em>PLoS ONE</em>. AEs can employ a variety of  methods to reach a decision in which they are confident:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on their own knowledge and experience</li>
  <li>Through discussion with other members of the  editorial board</li>
  <li>Through the solicitation of formal reports from  independent external referees </li>
</ul>
<p>After appropriate consideration by the AE, a decision letter to the author  is drafted. This letter may also be circulated to other members of the  editorial board, who are given a short time to comment on the editorial  decision. </p>
  <p>There are several types of decisions possible: </p>
<ul>

  <li>Accept in principle</li>
  <li>Minor revision</li>
  <li>Major revision</li>
  <li>Reject </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon acceptance, the manuscript is checked  by <em>PLoS ONE</em> staff to ensure that it  is in a form that will allow it to be efficiently handled by our production  system. The authors will be queried and allowed to make any final minor  revisions that are needed.</p>

<p>This is the final stage at which  authors  will see their manuscript before publication. The authors' files will be carefully tagged to generate XML and PDF files, but will not be subject to detailed copyediting (see <a href="guidelines.action#production" title="PLoS ONE | Authors Guidelines">Overview of the Production Process</a>). It is therefore  essential that authors provide a thoroughly proofread and checked manuscript,  following the author checklist and any comments from PLoS staff.</p>

<h2><a name="selection" id="selection">4. Reviewer Selection</a></h2>
<p>Selection of reviewers for a particular manuscript is the responsibility of  the AE and is based on many factors, including expertise, reputation, specific  recommendations of authors and academic editors, and the AE's own knowledge of  a reviewer's past performance.</p>
 <p>As part of our editorial procedure, we confer with potential reviewers  before sending them manuscripts to review. Reviewers should bear in mind that  even these initial messages or conversations contain confidential information,  which should be regarded as such.</p>

<h2><a name="writing" id="writing"></a>5. Writing the Review</h2>
<p>The purpose of the review is to provide the editors with an expert opinion  regarding the quality of the manuscript under consideration. The review should  also supply authors with explicit feedback on how to improve their papers so  that they are acceptable for publication in <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Although  confidential comments to the editors are respected, any remarks that might help  to strengthen the paper should be directed to the authors themselves. A good  review would answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the main claims of the paper?</li>
  <li>Are the claims properly placed in the context of the previous literature?</li>
  <li>Do the experimental data support the claims? If not, what other evidence is required?</li>
  <li>Who would find this paper of interest? And why?</li>
  <li>What further directions would it be useful to take the current research? </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="other" id="other"></a>6. Other Questions for Consideration</h2>
<p>In the case of manuscripts deemed worthy of publication, we would appreciate  additional advice from the reviewer on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the manuscript written clearly enough that it is understandable to non-specialists? If not, how could it be improved?</li>
  <li>Have the authors provided adequate proof for their claims without overselling them?</li>
  <li>Have the authors treated the previous literature fairly?</li>
  <li>Does the paper offer enough details of its methodology that its experiments could be reproduced?</li>

  <li><em>PLoS ONE</em> encourages authors to publish detailed protocols as supporting information online. Do any particular methods used in the manuscript warrant such a protocol?</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="confidentiality" id="confidentiality"></a>7. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>The review process is strictly confidential and should be treated as such by  reviewers. Because the author may have chosen to exclude some people from this  process, no one not directly involved with the manuscript, including colleagues  or other experts in the field, should be consulted by the reviewer unless such  consultations have first been discussed with the AE. </p>

<h2><a name="timely" id="timely"></a>8. Timely Review</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> believes that an efficient editorial process that results  in timely publication provides a valuable service both to authors and to the  scientific community at large. We therefore request that reviewers respond  promptly, usually within ten days of receipt of a manuscript. If reviewers need  more time, we request that they contact us promptly so that we can keep the  authors informed and, if necessary, assign alternative reviewers.</p>

<h2><a name="anonymity" id="anonymity"></a>9. Anonymity</h2>
<p>Although reviewers may remain anonymous during the review process, we  strongly urge them to relinquish this anonymity to promote open and transparent  decision-making.</p>

<h2><a name="editing" id="editing"></a>10. Editing Reviewers' Reports</h2>
<p>The editors and PLoS staff do not edit any comments made by reviewers that have been intended to be read by the authors unless the language is deemed inappropriate for professional communication or the comments contain information considered confidential. Such remarks should be reserved for the confidential section of the review form, which is intended to be read by the editors only. In their comments to authors, reviewers are encouraged to be honest but not offensive in their language. On the other hand, authors should not confuse frank and perhaps even robust language with unfair criticism.</p>

<h2><a name="competing" id="competing"></a>11. Competing Interests</h2>
<p>As far as possible, we respect requests by authors to exclude reviewers whom they consider to be unsuitable. We also, as much as possible, try to rule out those reviewers who may have an obvious competing interest, such as those who may have been collaborators on other projects with the authors of this manuscript, those who may be direct competitors, those who may have a known history of antipathy with the author(s), or those who might profit financially from this work. Because it is not possible for all such competing interests to be known by a particular editor, we request that reviewers who recognize a potential competing interest inform the editors or journal staff and recuse themselves if they feel that are unable to offer an impartial review.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href="competing.action" title="PLoS ONE | Competing Interests Policy">policy of the Public Library of Science regarding competing interests</a>. When submitting your review, you must indicate whether or not you have any competing interests. 
On occasion, reviewers may be asked to offer their opinion on a manuscript that they may have reviewed for some other journal. This is not in itself a competing interest. That two journals have identified the same person as especially well qualified to judge the manuscript under consideration does not in any way decrease the validity of that opinion and may perhaps even enhance it.</p>

<h2><a name="feedback" id="feedback">12. Feedback to Reviewers</a></h2>
<p>We send reviewers' comments along with the decision letter to reviewers of that manuscript. If reviewers have identified themselves, this information will be passed on to other reviewers. Reviewers who may have offered an opinion not in accordance with the final decision should not feel that their recommendation was not duly considered and their service not properly appreciated. Experts often disagree, and it is the job of the editorial team to make a decision.</p>

<h2><a name="sharing" id="sharing">13. Sharing Reviews with Other PLoS Journals</a></h2>
<p>PLoS publishes several journals. Occasionally, editors recommend after peer review that a particular article is more suitable for another PLoS journal. If the authors choose to pursue that option, we transfer the manuscript and the reviews to the other journal. We expect that reviewers for any PLoS journal are willing to have their reviews considered by the editors of another PLoS journal.</p>
