<h2 name="Annotation" id="Annotation">Annotation, Debate, and  Rating</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> employs a system that combines pre- and post-publication peer review. There are two major components to post-publication review:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Annotations</strong>: These are short notes overlaid on the Web version of the manuscript. These should be used to either highlight a minor  point, to make additions or corrections that apply to a specific point in the  text, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive discussions, presented elsewhere.<u></u></li>
  <li><strong>Debates</strong>: These are relatively conventional, threaded discussions concerning the  content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific paper. <u></u></li>

<!--  <li><strong>Ratings</strong>: Registered users can assign  personal ratings to papers that are then aggregated to provide overall ratings and rankings of  papers. Users are not allowed to &#8216;vote' more than once, but can revise their opinions. </li>-->
</ol>
<p> Contributors to Annotations and Debates will be identified. Anonymous contributions are not permitted.</p>

<h2 name="Qualification" id="Qualification">Qualification</h2>
<p><em>PLoS  ONE</em> is an open publication &#8211; anyone can register as  a user. Users will be required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply  a valid email address in order to register. Registration information will be  kept strictly confidential by PLoS staff except where explicitly indicated and agreed to by registrants. PLoS reserves the right to suspend registered user privileges at its own discretion.</p>

<h2 name="Good_Practice" id="Good_Practice">Good Practice</h2>
<p>All contributions must conform to the norms  of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet these  standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these  conventions will have their user privileges removed. </p>
<p>A partial list of commenting standards includes the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence based, not authority based.</li>
  <li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced. </li>

  <li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information can be provided.</li>
  <li>Arguments based on belief alone are  to be avoided. For example, the assertion "I don't believe the results in Figure 2" must be supported.</li>
  <li>Discussions should be confined  to the demonstrable content of papers and should avoid speculation about the  motivations or prejudices of authors. </li>
</ol>
<p>PLoS staff are the final arbiters of the  suitability of comments for inclusion in <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p>
