<a id="intro" name="intro"></a>
<h2>Annotation, Discussion, and Rating</h2>

<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> employs a system for the assessment of papers which combines pre- and post-publication peer review. There are two major components to post-publication review:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Annotation:</strong> These are short notes attached to the Web version of the article. These should be used to either highlight a minor point, to make additions or corrections that apply to a specific point in the text, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive discussions, presented elsewhere.</li>
	<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> These are relatively conventional, threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific paper. </li>
</ol>

<p>Contributors to annotations and discussions will be identified. </p>

<a id="terms" name="terms"></a>
<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

<p>All annotation, discussion, rating and other post-publication activity in <em>PLoS ONE</em> is subject to the <a href="terms.action" title="PLoS ONE | Terms of Use">PLoS Terms of Use</a>. </p>

<a id="who" name="who"></a>
<h2>Who can Contribute?</h2>

<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> is an open publication &#8211; anyone can register as a user. Users will be required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply a valid e-mail address in order to register. Registration information will be kept strictly confidential by PLoS staff unless otherwise indicated. PLoS reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user.</p>

<a id="annotation" name="annotation"></a>
<h2>How to Make an Annotation</h2>

<p>Annotations are indicated by small blue 'bugs' within the online text. Each bug contains a number indicating how many independent annotations begin at that point in the text. When you place the computer cursor over a bug, the text that has been annotated is transiently highlighted. Clicking on a bug displays the annotations starting at that point. The title, date, contributor, and first 250 text characters of an annotation are displayed. If there is more than one annotation, the title, date, and contributor of all annotations are shown. Full text of annotations longer than 250 characters can be viewed by clicking the 'View/respond to this' link or the title of the annotation.</p>

<p>To make an annotation, you must be logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Highlight the text to be annotated using a mouse or keyboard. (N.B. Annotations can be started at any point within the text and can extend over any length of text; however, for ease of reading we ask that users do not begin annotations in the middle of words.) To add the text of an annotation, click the 'Add your annotation' link in the right hand navigation menu. Enter the title and text of the annotation in the appropriate boxes. Once you are satisfied with what you've  written, click the 'Post' button to attach the annotation to the article. Links are automatically generated to correctly-formed URLs.  (N.B. we advise that longer annotations should be first written in a word-processing program which allows for spell-checking before being copied and pasted into <em>PLoS ONE</em>.)  </p>

<a id="discussion" name="discussion"></a>
<h2>How to Begin a Discussion</h2>

<p>To view threaded discussions on an article, click the 'See all commentary' link in the right hand navigation menu. This produces a list of all discussion and annotation threads relating to a particular article. </p>

<p>To initiate a discussion about the paper as a whole, you must be logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. To upload the initial comment in a discussion, click the 'Start a discussion' link in the right hand navigation menu of the article. Enter the title and text of the comment in the appropriate boxes. Once you are satisfied with what you've written, click the 'Post' button to attach the discussion comment to the article. Links are automatically generated to correctly-formed URLs.  (N.B. we advise that discussion comments should be first written in a word-processing program which allows for spell-checking before being copied and pasted into <em>PLoS ONE</em>.)</p>

<a id="responding" name="responding"></a>
<h2>Responding to Annotations and Discussions</h2>

<p>To respond to annotations or discussion comments, you must be logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Click the 'View/respond to this' link at the bottom of annotations or the 'Respond to this Posting' link in the bottom right corner of discussion comments. Enter the text of the response in the appropriate box. You may also edit the title . Once you are satisfied with what you've written, click the 'Post' button to attach the response to the article. Links are automatically generated to correctly-formed URLs.  (N.B. we advise that longer responses should be first written in a word-processing program which allows for spell-checking before being copied and pasted into <em>PLoS ONE</em>.)</p>

<p>In this way an unlimited number of branching threads can be created, anchored either to an initial annotation or discussion. If any comment is removed following moderation, all subsequent comments along its thread will also be removed.</p>

<a id="goodpractice" name="goodpractice"></a>
<h2>Good Practice</h2>

<p>All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these conventions will have their user privileges removed. </p>

<p>A partial list of commenting standards includes the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
	<li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence based, not authority based.</li>
	<li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and where possible a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied. </li>
	<li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information can be provided.</li>
	<li>Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example, the assertion "I don't believe the results in Figure 2" must be supported.</li>
	<li>Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of papers and should avoid speculation about the motivations or prejudices of users. </li>
</ol>

<p>PLoS staff are the final arbiters of the suitability of comments for inclusion in <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p>

<a id="identifying" name="identifying"></a>
<h2>Identifying Inappropriate Content</h2>

<p>If a user identifies a comment that they believe to be inappropriate they should 'flag' the comment for moderation. Click the 'Flag for Moderation' link towards the bottom right of a comment, then indicate briefly why the comment is inappropriate (for example Spam, Offensive, etc.). PLoS staff will investigate the comment, which may involve consulting external experts if necessary. Any comments that are deemed to be inappropriate by PLoS staff will be removed. Any users who consistently post inappropriate material will have their user privileges removed.  If a comment is removed following moderation, all subsequent comments along its thread  will also be removed.</p>
