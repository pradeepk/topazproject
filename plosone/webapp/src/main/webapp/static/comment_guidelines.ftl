<a id="intro" name="intro"></a>
<h2>1. Annotation, Discussion, and Rating</h2>

<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> employs a system for the assessment of papers that combines pre- and post-publication peer review. There are three major components to post-publication review:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Annotations:</strong> These are short notes attached to the Web version of the manuscript. These should be used either to highlight a minor point, to make additions or corrections that apply to a specific point in the text, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive discussions, presented elsewhere.</li>
	<li><strong>Discussions:</strong> These are relatively conventional threaded discussions concerning the content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific paper. </li>
	<li><strong>Ratings:</strong> Registered users can assign personal ratings to papers, which are then aggregated to provide overall ratings and rankings of papers. Users are not allowed to "vote" more than once, but can revise their rating. (Rating will not be available at launch, but will be introduced soon afterwards.) </li>
</ol>

<p>Authors of all Annotation and Discussion comments will be identified. </p>

<a id="terms" name="terms"></a>
<h2>2. Terms of Use</h2>

<p>All Annotation, Discussion, Rating and other post-publication activity in <em>PLoS ONE</em> is subject to the  <a href="terms.action" title="PLoS ONE | Terms of Use">PLoS Terms of Use</a>. </p>

<a id="who" name="who"></a>
<h2>3. Who can Contribute?</h2>

<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> is an open publication &#8212; anyone can register as a user. Users are required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply a valid e-mail address in order to register. Registration information will be kept strictly confidential by PLoS staff unless otherwise indicated. PLoS reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user.</p>

<a id="annotation" name="annotation"></a>
<h2>4. How to Create and View Annotations</h2>


<p>To make an Annotation, first make sure you are logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Then, highlight the text to be annotated, and then click the "Add your annotation" link in the right-hand navigation menu. Enter the title and text for the annotation, and when you are satisfied, click "Post" to attach the Annotation to the manuscript. Any correctly formed URLs in Annotations automatically will become working links. </p>

<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Annotations can be started at any point within the text, but for ease of reading we ask that you do not begin Annotations in the middle of words.</li>
	<li>We advise that longer Annotations are first written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Annotations are represented by the small blue "bugs" within the online text. The number in the bug indicates the number of Annotations that begin at that point in the text. To see what selection of text is associated with an Annotation, run the cursor over the bug, and the text will be transiently highlighted. Click on the bug to view the title, date, contributor, and first 250 text characters of an Annotation. For Annotations longer than 250 characters, click the "View/respond to this" link to view the full text. </p>

<a id="discussion" name="discussion"></a>
<h2>5.How to Begin and View Discussions</h2>

<p>To initiate a Discussion about the paper as a whole, first make sure you are logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. To create the initial comment for a Discussion, click the "Start a discussion" link in the right-hand navigation menu of the manuscript, and then enter the title and text of the comment in the appropriate boxes. (Note: We advise that Discussion comments first are written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into PLoS ONE.) When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the comment to the manuscript. Any correctly formed URLs in Discussion comments automatically will become working links. </p>

<p>To view threaded Discussions on a manuscript, click the "See all commentary" link in the right-hand navigation menu. This produces a list of all Discussion and Annotation threads associated with the article.  </p>


<a id="responding" name="responding"></a>
<h2>6. Responding to Annotation and Discussion Comments</h2>

<p>To respond to a Discussion or Annotation comment, first make sure you are logged into <em>PLoS ONE</em>. Then, for Annotations, click the "View/respond to this" link at the bottom of the Annotation. For Discussions, click the "Respond to this posting" link in the bottom-right corner of the Discussion comments. Enter the text of your response in the appropriate box. (Note: We advise that responses first are written in a word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into <em>PLoS ONE</em>.) When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the response to the Annotation or Discussion. Any correctly formed URLs in responses automatically will become working links.</p>

<p>Following this procedure, an unlimited number of branching threads can be anchored to an initial Annotation or Discussion. If any comment is removed following moderation, all subsequent comments along its thread also will be removed. </p>

<a id="goodpractice" name="goodpractice"></a>
<h2>7. Good Practice</h2>

<p>All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions that do not meet these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these conventions will have their user privileges removed. </p>

<p>A partial list of commenting standards includes the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
	<li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence-based, not authority-based.</li>
	<li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and, where possible, a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied. </li>
	<li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information should be provided.</li>
	<li>Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example the assertion, "I don't believe the results in Figure 2." must be supported.</li>
	<li>Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of papers and should avoid speculation about the motivations or prejudices of authors. </li>
</ol>

<p>PLoS staff are the final arbiters of the suitability of comments for inclusion in <em>PLoS ONE</em>.</p>

<a id="inappropriatecontent" name="inappropriatecontent"></a>
<h2>8. Requesting Review of Inappropriate Content</h2>

<p>To request review of a comment you believe to be inappropriate, click the "Request review" link at the bottom right of the comment in question. Briefly indicate why you feel the comment is inappropriate (for example, "Spam," "Offensive," etc.). PLoS staff will investigate the comment, which may involve consulting external experts if necessary. Any comments that PLoS staff deem to be inappropriate will be removed. Any users who consistently post inappropriate material will have their user privileges removed.  If a comment is removed, all subsequent comments along its thread also will be removed.</p>
