<p class="intro">As part of the process of making scientific and medical literature freely available on the Web, PLoS uses a streamlined production process that takes authors' figures straight to layout. We appreciate every effort authors put toward ensuring that their figures meet our specifications.</p>

<p>Authors should submit their figures as close to "camera-ready" as possible. In other words, the figures should look exactly how they need to look in a print-ready PDF&#8212;properly sized, with fonts and labels at an appropriate size, and produced in a high-resolution format. The following steps will help you meet these criteria; please read them carefully.</p>

<p>Ultimately the art department will manipulate each figure, taking into consideration multiple factors (font size, overall layout, resolution, etc). They will size figures at either 1-, 1.5-, or 2-column width.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER</strong><br />
 Simply because a figure looks good on screen, this does not mean it will look good in the printed PDF. For reassurance, size figure to intended dimensions and print them on your personal printer; the PLoS product should look relatively similar to the home-printer copy.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Select Color Mode</h2>
<p>Our printing process requires that your images be in either RGB or grayscale. Please adjust your color settings before beginning your work.</p>

<a name="type" id="type"></a>
<h2>Step 2: Determine Figure Type (Vector vs. Raster)</h2>

<h3>Vector Graphics (Computer-Generated Line Art Images)</h3>
<p>Common examples of vector graphics are text, tables, charts, graphs, and gene sequences. Vector graphics are mathematically defined geometric shapes that can be independently manipulated. The distinguishing feature of a vector graphic is that it has sharp, clean lines and crisp edges at any size and shape. To prepare and manipulate vector graphics, you can use Adobe Illustrator, PowerPoint, or a comparable vector-drawing program.</p>

<p>Vector graphic file types are the following: .PDF, .EPS, .AI, .PPT, and .DOC files.</p>

<p>If you are using Adobe Illustrator CS2 (Version 11), please export your file and select file type "Adobe Illustrator Legacy AI." On the next dialogue box, select "Version 10" and check "Create PDF compatible file" and "Use compression."</p>

<p>*If your vector graphic file contains ANY raster images, it is considered a combination figure (please see below for details).</p>

<h3>Raster Images (Non-Line Art Images)</h3>

<p>Common examples of raster images are photographs, gels, stains, microarrays, brain scans, and molecular structures. Raster images are created from a collection of countless tiny squares, called pixels. To prepare and manipulate raster images, use PhotoShop or a comparable photo-editing program. Be sure your originals are high resolution. We require these images to be a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. The figure should not look fuzzy, jagged, pixilated, or grainy at intended print size.</p>

<p>Raster image-based file types are the following: .TIFF, .JPG, .BMP, and .GIF files.</p>

<p>*If your raster image file contains ANY text or computer-generated line art, it is considered a combination figure (please see below for details).</p>

<h3>Combination Figures (Vector Combined with Raster Images)</h3>
<p>Combination figures use both vector and raster images. Common examples of combination figures can be multipanel figures, graphs, diagrams, and anything with text laid over an image (including panel labels: A, B, C, etc.).</p>

<p>If saving as a raster file (.TIFF, .JPG, .BMP, .GIF), the resolution must be at least 600 dpi. Conversely, if saving as a vector file (.PDF, .EPS, .AI, .PPT, .DOC), all raster images placed within need to be at least 300 dpi.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER</strong><br />
 The quality of your figures will only be as good as the lowest-resolution element placed in them. In other words, if you use a 72 dpi line graph and make it a 600 dpi TIFF, the image will still print out as a 72 dpi image, resulting in very poor quality. The presentation of the figures can affect the quality of your article.</p>

<a name="dimensions" id="dimensions"></a>
<h2>Step 3: Choose Figure Dimensions</h2>
<p>After removing all excess white space, figures should be sized  depending on article type. For research articles, figures should have a  width between 9 cm and 18 cm. For all other article types (essays,  reviews, etc.), figures should have a width between 5.5 cm and 18 cm.  Regardless of article type, figures cannot have a height of more than  24 cm. All figures will be left-aligned on the page or column, so  please design accordingly.</p>

  <p><strong>Research Articles</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>Width: 9 cm&#8211;18 cm (or ~3.5 in&#8211;7 in)</li>
    <li>Height: 1 cm&#8211;24 cm (or ~0.5 in&#8211;9.5 in)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>All Other Article Types</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>Width: 5.5 cm&#8211;18 cm (or ~2.2 in&#8211;7 in)</li>
    <li>Height: 1 cm&#8211;24 cm (or ~0.5 in&#8211;9.5 in)</li>
  </ul>
 <p>*Stereo figures should be sized 63 mm from the center of the left image to the center of the right image.</p>
  
<a name="text" id="text"></a>

<h2>Step 4: Choose Figure Text</h2>

<p>Label your figure panels with in Arial bold font, 12 point, with  capital letters. Do NOT use any punctuation (no periods or brackets)!  All other figure text must be in Arial font, between 6 and 10 points.</p>

<p>Always embed fonts when using vector file types. Special symbols and  Greek characters will not reproduce properly unless you embed the fonts.</p>

<a name="format" id="format"></a>
<h2>Step 5: Choose File Format/Size</h2>
<p>Each figure (including all supporting information figures) must be under 10 MB to optimize online accessibility.</p>
  <p>You may submit your image files in these formats*:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Highly preferred: .EPS, .PDF, and .TIFF</li>
    <li>Also accepted: .AI, .PPT, .PSD, .DOC, .JPG**, .GIF, .BMP</li>
  </ul>

<p>When saving as .TIFF files, please choose compression option LZW  (this will greatly reduce file size while retaining quality). Some  programs may downsample your images to low resolution. Do not use the  "optimize for Web" wizard in PowerPoint or PhotoShop for any figures.</p>
<p><strong>* Please note: <em>PLoS ONE</em> will only accept figures in .TIFF or .EPS format and no others.</strong></p>

<p>** .JPG is a lossy file format. Every time you save a .JPG, quality  is lost and pixels are actually thrown away with each successive save.  Please submit first-generation .JPGs only.</p>

<a name="video" id="video"></a>
<h2>Step 6: Upload Video and Motion Graphics</h2>

<p>We encourage authors to submit multimedia files that are crucial to  the conclusions of the paper. Video files should be submitted as  uncompressed .AVI, .MOV, .WMV, or .RV files, and PLoS will compress the  files to an appropriate size and quality.</p>

<p>Other multimedia files (e.g., .SWF) should be smaller than 10 MB in  size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in  loading or downloading files.</p>
