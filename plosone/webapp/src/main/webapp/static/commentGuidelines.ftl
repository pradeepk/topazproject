  <h2>1. Annotation, Discussion, and Rating</h2>

  <p>The PLoS Web site employs a system for the assessment of articles that combines
   pre- and post-publication peer review. There are three major components to post-publication review:</p>

  <@s.url action="ratingGuidelines" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="rateGuideURL"/>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Annotations:</strong> These are short notes attached to the Web version of the article.
      These should be used either to highlight a minor point, to make additions or corrections that apply
      to a specific point in the text, or to identify and link to material, including more extensive
      discussions, presented elsewhere.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discussions:</strong> These are relatively conventional threaded discussions concerning
      the content, conclusions, and consequences of a specific article.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ratings:</strong> Users can assign personal ratings to articles, which are then
      aggregated to provide overall ratings and rankings of articles. Users are not allowed to "vote"
      more than once, but can revise their rating. For more details, see
      <@s.a href="${rateGuideURL}" title="Guidelines for Rating">Guidelines for Rating</@s.a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Authors of all Annotation, Discussion, and Ratings will be identified. </p>

  <a id="terms" name="terms"></a>
  <h2>2. Terms of Use</h2>

  <@s.url action="terms" namespace="/static" includeParams="none" id="termsURL"/>
  <p>All Annotation, Discussion, Rating and other post-publication activity in the PLoS Web sites is
  subject to the <@s.a href="${termsURL}" title="Terms of Use">PLoS Terms of Use</@s.a>. </p>

  <a id="who" name="who"></a>
  <h2>3. Who Can Contribute?</h2>

  <p>All registered users are able to comment on and rate any article. Anyone can register as a user.
  Users are required to unambiguously identify themselves and to supply a valid e-mail address in order
  to register. Registration information will be kept strictly confidential by PLoS staff unless otherwise
  indicated. PLoS reserves the right to suspend the privileges of any registered user. Commenting and
  rating is not anonymous.</p>

  <a id="annotation" name="annotation"></a>
  <h2>4. How to Create and View Annotations</h2>

  <p>To make an Annotation, first make sure you are logged into the Web site. Then, highlight the text
  to be annotated, and then click the "Add your annotation" link in the right-hand navigation menu of
  the article. Enter a title and text for your annotation in the appropriate boxes. When you are
  satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Annotation to the article. Any correctly formed
  URLs in the Annotation text field will automatically become working links. </p>

  <p>Notes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Annotations can be started at any point within the text, but for ease of reading we ask that
    you do not begin Annotations in the middle of words.</li>
    <li>We advise that longer Annotations are first written in a word-processing program that
    allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Annotations are represented by the small blue "bugs" within the online text. The number in the
  bug indicates the number of Annotations that begin at that point in the text. To see what selection
  of text is associated with an Annotation, run the cursor over the bug, and the text will be
  transiently highlighted. Click on the bug to view the title, date, contributor, and first 250
  text characters of an Annotation. For Annotations longer than 250 characters, click the
  "View/respond to this" link to view the full text. </p>

  <a id="discussion" name="discussion"></a>
  <h2>5. How to Begin and View Discussions</h2>

  <p>To initiate a Discussion about the article as a whole, first make sure you are logged
  into the Web site. To create the initial comment for a Discussion, click the "Start a discussion"
  link in the right-hand navigation menu of the article. Enter a title and text for your comment
  in the appropriate boxes. (Note: We advise that Discussion comments first are written in a
  word-processing program that allows for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into
  the comment field.) When you are satisfied with the text, click "Post" to attach the Discussion
  comment to the article. Any correctly formed URLs in the Discussion text field will automatically
  become working links. </p>

  <p>To view threaded commentary on an article, click the "See all commentary" link in the
  right-hand navigation menu of the article. This produces a list of all Annotations and Discussions
  threads associated with the article.</p>

  <a id="responding" name="responding"></a>
  <h2>6. Responding to Annotation and Discussion Comments</h2>

  <p>To respond to a Discussion or Annotation comment, first make sure you are logged into the Web site.
  For Annotations, open an an Annotation and click the "View/respond to this" link at the bottom of
  the Annotation. For Annotations and Discussions, click the "Respond to this Posting" link in the
  bottom-right corner of the comment. Enter a title and text for your response in the appropriate
  boxes. (Note: We advise that responses first are written in a word-processing program that allows
  for spell checking before they are copied and pasted into the comment field.) When you are satisfied
  with the text, click "Post" to attach the response to the Annotation or Discussion. Any correctly
  formed URLs in the response text field will automatically become working links.</p>

  <p>Following this procedure, an unlimited number of branching threads can be anchored to an initial
  Annotation or Discussion. If any comment is removed following moderation, all subsequent comments
  along its thread also will be removed. </p>

  <a id="goodpractice" name="goodpractice"></a>
  <h2>7. Good Practice</h2>

  <p>All contributions must conform to the norms of civilized scientific discussion. Any contributions
  that do not meet these standards will be removed. Any users who consistently transgress these
  conventions will have their user privileges removed. </p>

  <p>A partial list of commenting standards includes the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Language that is insulting, inflammatory, or obscene will not be tolerated.</li>
    <li>Unsupported assertions or statements should be avoided. Comments must be evidence-based, not
    authority-based.</li>
    <li>When previously published studies are cited, they must be accurately referenced and,
    where possible, a DOI and link to a publicly accessible version supplied. </li>
    <li>Unpublished data should be provided with sufficient methodological detail for those data
    to be assessed. Alternatively, a permanent Web link to such information should be provided.</li>
    <li>Arguments based on belief are to be avoided. For example the assertion, "I don't believe
    the results in Figure 2." must be supported.</li>
    <li>Discussions should be confined to the demonstrable content of articles and should avoid
    speculation about the motivations or prejudices of authors. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>PLoS is the final arbiter of the suitability of comments for inclusion in the PLoS Web sites.</p>

  <a id="inappropriatecontent" name="inappropriatecontent"></a>
  <h2>8. Requesting Review of Inappropriate Content</h2>

  <p>We encourage you to request review of an Annotation or Discussion comment you believe to
  be inappropriate. For Annotations, open an an Annotation and click the "View/respond to this"
  link at the bottom of the Annotation. For Annotations and Discussions, click the "Request review"
  link in the bottom-right corner of the comment. Indicate why the comment should be reviewed
  ("Spam," "Offensive," "Inappropriate," or "Other"), enter additional information in the text box,
  and click "Submit". PLoS staff will investigate the comment, which may involve consulting external
  experts if necessary. Any comments that PLoS staff deem to be inappropriate will be removed. Any
  users who consistently posts inappropriate material will have their user privileges removed.  If
  a comment is removed, all subsequent comments along its thread also will be removed.</p>

  <p>PLoS is the final arbiter of the suitability of comments for inclusion in the PLoS Web sites.</p>
