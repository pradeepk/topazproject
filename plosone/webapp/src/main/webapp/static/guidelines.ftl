<h2>1. About <em>PLoS ONE</em></h2>
<p>Scientific progress requires the exchange and discussion of data and ideas. <em>PLoS ONE </em>is a unique publication dedicated to presenting the results of scientific research from any scientific discipline in an open-access environment. At the same time, it provides a forum in which to discuss that scientific research and so provide for each and every paper its maximum possible impact. To achieve this, <em>PLoS ONE</em> employs a two-stage assessment process. Pre-publication peer review concentrates on objective and technical concerns to determine whether the research has been sufficiently well conceived, well executed, and well described to justify inclusion in the scientific record. Post-publication, papers are opened up for interactive discussions and assessment in which the whole scientific community can be involved. </p>

<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses&#8212;including those of peer review, journal production, and online hosting and archiving&#8212;are recovered in part by charging a publication fee to the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. For <em>PLoS ONE</em> the publication fee is US$1250.  Authors who are affiliated with one of our <a href="http://www.plos.org/support/instmembers.html" title="PLoS.org | Institutional Members">Institutional Members</a> are eligible for a discount on this fee.</p>

<p>We offer a complete or partial fee waiver for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to payment information, and hence inability to pay will not influence the decision to publish a paper.</p> 

<a name="criteria" id="criteria"></a>
<h2>2. Criteria for Publication</h2>
<p>To be considered for publication in <em>PLoS ONE</em>, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Results reported have not been published elsewhere. </li>
 <li>Experiments, statistics, and other analyses are performed to a high technical standard. </li>
 <li>Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion. </li>

 <li>Techniques used have been documented in sufficient detail to allow replication.</li>
 <li>Reports are presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English.</li>
 <li>Research meets all applicable standards, including the <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm" title="WMA.net | Declaration of Helsinki">Helsinki Declaration</a>, with regard to the ethics of human and animal experimentation, consent, and research integrity.</li>
 <li>Report adheres to the relevant community standards for research, reporting, and deposition of data. (<a  href="#requirements">Standards PLoS promotes</a> across its journals).</li>
</ul>

<a name="editorial" id="editorial"></a>
<h2>3. Overview of the Editorial Process</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> will provide all authors with an efficient and "hassle-free" editorial process. Our aim is to identify those submissions that warrant inclusion in the scientific record and present them to the scientific community with as few hurdles as possible.</p>
<p>The editorial process is run by its extensive board of academic editors (AEs). AEs are invited to handle submitted manuscripts based upon the content of the manuscript. The AE evaluates the paper and decides whether it describes a body of work that meets the editorial criteria of <em>PLoS ONE</em>. AEs can employ a variety of methods to reach a decision in which they are confident:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Based on their own knowledge and experience</li>
 <li>Through discussion with other members of the editorial board</li>
 <li>Through the solicitation of formal reports from independent external referees </li>
</ul>
<p>After appropriate consideration by the AE, a decision letter to the author is drafted. This letter may also be circulated to other members of the editorial board, who are given a short time to comment on the editorial decision. </p>
 <p>There are several types of decisions possible: </p>
<ul>

 <li>Accept in principle</li>
 <li>Minor revision</li>
 <li>Major revision</li>
 <li>Reject </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon acceptance, the manuscript is checked by <em>PLoS ONE</em> staff to ensure that it is in a form that will allow it to be efficiently handled by our production system. The authors will be queried and allowed to make any final minor revisions that are needed.</p>

<p>This is the final stage at which an author will see their manuscript before publication. The authors' files will be carefully tagged to generate XML and PDF files, but will not be subject to detailed copyediting (see <a href="#production">Overview of the Production Process</a>). It is therefore essential that authors provide a thoroughly proofread and checked manuscript, following the manuscript checklist and any comments from PLoS staff.</p>

<a name="presubs" id="presubs"></a>
<h2>4. Presubmission Inquiries</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> does not consider presubmission inquiries. Such inquiries essentially request that the editors of a journal assess whether the paper is of potential interest to that journal by virtue of its subject area, novelty, or anticipated impact. In general, such subjective opinion would have little bearing on whether a paper should be published in <em>PLoS ONE</em>. To judge whether a study has been sufficiently well performed and well documented to permit publication in <em>PLoS ONE</em> requires submission of the full paper.</p>

<a name="preparation" id="preparation"></a>
<h2>5. Preparation of Research Manuscripts</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> considers manuscripts of any length; we encourage the submission of both substantial full-length bodies of work and shorter manuscripts based on a more limited range of experiments. There are no explicit word, figure, or supporting information restrictions, although we encourage a concise and accessible writing style. Editors may make suggestions for how to achieve this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the arguments made. Authors are encouraged to use their own voice and to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions. </p>

 <p>Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in English. As a step toward overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors fluent in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or abstracts in other languages; these will be made available along with the published paper. Translations should be submitted as supporting information.</p>
 
<h3>Cover Letter </h3>
<p>It is important that you include a cover letter with your manuscript. Please explain why this manuscript is suitable for publication in <em>PLoS ONE</em>. How does your paper provide a worthwhile addition to the scientific literature? How does your paper relate to previously published work? Which types of scientists do you believe will be most interested in your study?</p>

<h3>Electronic Formats </h3>
<p>Our publication system supports a limited range of formats for text and graphics. Text files can be submitted in only the following formats: Word or RTF. Please <a href="latex.action" title="PLoS ONE | Converting LaTeX files to Word or RTF format">convert LaTeX files to RTF format</a>. Graphics files can only be submitted in the following formats: EPS or TIFF.</p>
<p>If you experience difficulties with the manuscript submission Web site or are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact the journal (<strong>plosone [at] plos.org</strong>).</p>

<h3>Prior Publication</h3>
<p>When submitting their article, all authors are asked to indicate that they have not submitted a similar manuscript for publication elsewhere. If related work has been submitted elsewhere, then a copy must be included with the article submitted to PLoS.   Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>Before submitting your manuscript, please collect information on the sources of funding that have supported the work. When you submit you will be required to provide a statement in the online submission system declaring the funding sources, and also stating the role of the study sponsor(s), if any, in study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the paper; and decision to submit it for publication. </p>

<h3>Competing Interests </h3>

<p>The submitting author is asked at submission to declare, on behalf of all authors, whether there are any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced the paper. Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. Read more about the <a href="competing.action" title="PLoS ONE | Competing Interests Policy">policy of PLoS regarding competing interests</a>.</p>

<h3>Abbreviations</h3>

<p>Please keep abbreviations to a minimum and define them upon first use in the text. Non-standard abbreviations should not be used unless they appear at least three times in the text.</p>

<h3>Figures </h3>
<p>For the article to be accepted for publication, the author will need to supply high-resolution versions of the figures. When preparing your figures, please ensure that the files conform to our Guidelines for Figure Preparation. Please do <strong>not</strong> upload panels for a single figure separately (for example, Figure 1A, Figure 1B-1D, Figure 1E); each figure file should be a single montage of all panels. </p>
<p>Please note that <em>PLoS ONE</em> can only accept figures submitted as either TIFF or EPS files. </p>


<h3>Organization of the Manuscript </h3>
<p>Most articles published in <em>PLoS ONE</em> are organized in one of three fashions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, Materials and Methods, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, and Tables. </li>
 <li>Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, and Tables.</li>
 <li>Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Introduction, Analysis, Discussion, Acknowledgments, References, Figure Legends, and Tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>We advise that abstracts should not exceed 250&#8211;300 words. There are no specific length restrictions for the remaining sections of the manuscript; however, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely.</p>

<p>Standard Microsoft Word templates are available to help authors prepare their manuscripts. The templates consist of a standard set of headings that make up research articles of various types, with guidance regarding what to include in each section. </p>

<p>Download templates:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="tpl_plos_research_general.doc" title="">Standard Research article</a></li>
 <li><a href="tpl_plos_clinical_general.doc" title="">Clinical Research article</a></li>
 <li><a href="tpl_plos_meta.doc" title="">Systematic Review / Meta-Analysis article</a></li>
 <li><a href="tpl_plos_clinicaltrials.doc" title="">Clinical Trial article</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Title (150 characters or fewer)</h3>
<p>The title should be specific to the project, yet concise. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field. Avoid specialist abbreviations, if possible. Titles should be presented in title case, meaning that all words except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions should be capitalized. </p>

  <p><em>Example:</em><br />
 Detection of Specific Sequences among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel Electrophoresis</p>
 <p>During the online submission process, you will also provide a brief "running head" of fewer than 30 characters.</p>

<h3>Authors and Affiliations</h3>
<p>Provide the first names or initials (if used), middle names or initials (if used), surnames, and affiliations&#8212;department, university or organization, city, state/province (if applicable), and country&#8212;for all authors. One of the authors should be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author’s responsibility to ensure that the author list, and the summary of the author contributions to the study are accurate and complete. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all author names and affiliations should be listed at the end of the article.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The abstract succinctly introduces the paper. We advise that it should not exceed 250&#8211;300 words. It should mention the techniques used without going into methodological detail and should summarize the most important results. The abstract is conceptually divided into the following three sections: Background, Methodology/Principal Findings, and Conclusions/Significance. Please do not include any citations in the abstract. Avoid specialist abbreviations if possible. </p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>Registration details should be included when reporting results of a clinical trial (see "<a href="#reportingct">Reporting Clinical Trials</a>" for details). For each location that your trial is registered, please list: Name of registry; registry number; URL of your trial in the registry database. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the introduction, think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved. </p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The results section should provide details of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section. The section may be divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supporting information files; these are published online alongside the accepted article. We advise that the results section be written in past tense. </p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The discussion should spell out the major conclusions of the work along with some explanation or speculation on the significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The discussion should be concise and tightly argued. Conclusions firmly established by the presented data, hypotheses supported by the presented data, and speculations suggested by the presented data should be clearly identified as such. The results and discussion may be combined into one section, if desired. </p>

<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
<p>This section should provide enough detail to allow full replication of the study by suitably skilled investigators. Protocols for new methods should be included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. We encourage authors to submit, as separate supporting information files, detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods. These are published online only, but are linked to the article and are fully searchable. </p>

<h3>Acknowledgments </h3>
<p>Details of the funding sources that have supported the work should be confined to the funding statement provided in the online submission system. Do not include them in the acknowledgments.</p>

<h3>References </h3>
<p>Only published or accepted manuscripts should be included in the reference list. Meetings abstracts, conference talks, or papers that have been submitted but not yet accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be included in the body of the text only. All personal communications should be supported by a letter from the relevant authors.</p>

<p>PLoS uses the numbered citation (citation&#8211;sequence) method. References are listed and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. In the text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in brackets. Multiple citations within a single set of brackets should be separated by commas. Where there are more than three sequential citations, they should be given as a range. Example: "... has been shown previously [1,4&#8211;6,22]." Make sure the parts of the manuscript are in the correct order before ordering the citations. </p>

<p>Because all references will be linked electronically as much as possible to the papers they cite, proper formatting of the references is crucial. Please use the following style for the reference list:</p>


<p><em>Published Papers</em><br />
1 Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR (1977) DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 74: 5463&#8211;5467.</p>

<p>Please list the first five authors and then add "et al." if there are additional authors. Use of a DOI number to the full-text article is acceptable as an alternative to or in addition to traditional volume and page numbers. </p>

<p><em>Accepted Papers</em><br />
Same as above, but "in press" appears instead of the page numbers. Example: Adv Clin Path. In press. </p>

<h3>Figure Legends </h3>

<p>The aim of the figure legend should be to describe the key messages of the figure, but the figure should also be discussed in the text. An enlarged version of the figure and its full legend will often be viewed in a separate window online, and it should be possible for a reader to understand the figure without switching back and forth between this window and the relevant parts of the text. Each legend should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. The legend itself should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy descriptions of methods.</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<p>Tables should be included in the text file, at the very end of the manuscript.  All tables should have a concise title. Footnotes can be used to explain abbreviations. Citations should be indicated using the same style as outlined above. Tables occupying more than one printed page should be avoided, if possible. Larger tables can be published as online supporting information. Please ensure that table formatting conforms to our <a href="figureGuidelines.action">Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation</a>.</p> 

<h3>Multimedia Files and Supporting Information </h3>
<p>We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting material will be subject to peer review.</p>

<p>Multimedia files should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in loading or downloading files. Preferred formats for <em>PLoS ONE</em> are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Audio: MP3</li>
	<li>Video: MOV, progressive download, 320x240px frame size</li>
	<li>Flash: SWF</li>
</ul>

<p>Figures, tables, multimedia files, and datasets that make up the supporting information should be referred to in the manuscript with a leading capital S (e.g., Figure S4 for the fourth supporting information figure) and should fall into one of the following categories: Figure, Table, Text, Dataset, Audio, or Video. The numbered title and caption for each supporting information file should be entered into the appropriate fields in the online submission system. The information entered here will appear in the published version, so no supporting information titles or captions should be listed in the manuscript file.</p> 

<a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>
<h2>6. Discipline-Specific Requirements</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> fully supports the established standards of the fields that it covers. Some of these are detailed below:</p>

<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>The use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>We strongly encourage the use of <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/si/" title="BIPM | The International System of Units (SI)">SI units</a>. If you do not use these exclusively, please provide the SI value in parentheses after each value.</li>

<li>Species names should be italicized (e.g., <em>Homo sapiens</em>).</li>
<li>Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., <a href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/" title="HGNC | HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee">HUGO</a>. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or cellular localization should be shown in roman: v-fes, c-MYC, etc.</li>
<li>The Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN) of drugs should be provided.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Accession Numbers </h3>
<p>All appropriate datasets, images, and information should be deposited in public resources. Please provide the relevant accession numbers (and version numbers, if appropriate). Accession numbers should be provided in parentheses after the entity on first use.  Suggested databases include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">ArrayExpress</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Providing accession numbers allows linking to and from established databases and integrates your article with a broader collection of scientific information. </p>

<h3>Ethical Treatment of Research Subjects and Patient Consent</h3>
<p>All research involving humans and animals must have been approved by the authors' institutional review board or equivalent committee and that board must be named by the authors in their manuscript. In the case of human participants, informed consent must have been obtained and all clinical investigation must have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the <a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm" title="World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki | Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects">Declaration of Helsinki</a>. Authors must describe the process used for obtaining informed consent in their manuscript. Authors should submit a statement from the ethics committee or institutional review board indicating their approval of the research. We also encourage authors to submit a sample of a patient consent form and may require submission of completed forms on particular occasions.</p>

 
<h3>Patient Privacy and Informed Consent for Publication</h3>
<p>Our policy conforms to the <a href="http://www.icmje.org" title="ICMJE | Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication">Uniform Requirements</a>, which states: </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>"Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without informed consent. Identifying information should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that the patient be shown the manuscript to be published.</p>
	
	<p>Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve, and informed consent for publication should be obtained if there is any doubt. If data are changed to protect anonymity, authors should provide assurance that alterations of the data do not distort scientific meaning.</p>
	
	<p>When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the published article."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A signed form of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plos_consent_form.pdf" title="PLoS.org | Consent Form for Publication in a PLoS Journal (23KB PDF)">informed consent for publication</a> should be included as supporting information for the editors and reviewers of the manuscript. The PLoS open-access license means that the images and text we publish online become available for any lawful purpose. This information should be conveyed when obtaining consent for publication from patients.</p>


<a name="reportingct" id="reportingct"></a>
<h3>Reporting Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>Authors must submit original protocols for their clinical trial as supporting information to allow editors and reviewers to assess manuscripts fully. Any deviation from the protocol must be explained in the manuscript.</p>

<p>We require that authors of clinical trials adhere to the CONSORT reporting guidelines appropriate to their trial design. Please check the <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" title="Consort-Statement.org">CONSORT statement Web site</a> for information on the appropriate guidelines for specific trial types. All reports of the results of randomized clinical trials should include the CONSORT flow diagram as Figure 1, and authors should complete and submit the checklist contained within the CONSORT statement. </p>

<p>PLoS supports the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) on trial registration. All trials initiated after 1 July 2005 must be registered prospectively in a publicly accessible registry (i.e., before patient recruitment has begun), or they will not be considered for publication. For trials initiated before 1 July 2005, all trials must be registered before submission to our journals. The trial’s registration number must be provided at the time of submission. See the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq.pdf" title="ICMJE.org | FAQ">ICMJE faq</a> on trial registration for further details.</p>

<h2>7. Overview of the Production Process</h2>
<p>Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use language-editing and copyediting services, such as the ones described on the following Web sites. PLoS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.</p>
<p>Before formal acceptance, the manuscript will be checked by PLoS staff to ensure that it complies with all essential format requirements. The authors' files are then carefully tagged to generate XML and PDF files, but will not be subject to detailed copyediting. Obtaining this service is the responsibility of the author. </p>
