<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About PLoS and <em>PLoS ONE</em></h1>

<h2>Publishing in PLoS ONE</h2>

<h3>What is open-access publishing?</h3>
<p>
	All works published in PLoS journals are open access, licensed under the 
	<a href="license.php">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. Everything is immediately available 
	online without cost to anyone, anywhere&#8212;to read, download, redistribute, include in databases, 
	and otherwise use&#8212;subject only to the condition that the original authorship is properly 
	attributed. Copyright is retained by the author.
</p>
<p>
	Open access makes papers more useful by allowing sophisticated searching, manipulation, 
	and mining of the literature.
</p>

<h3>Why do we need open access when other journals release their content within a year after publication?</h3>
<p>
	Not many journals release their content for free, and those that do maintain restrictions on how that 
	free content may be used and distributed by readers. Furthermore, the delay they impose&#8212;often 6
	or 12 months&#8212;can be problematic for both authors and readers of medical research. Open-access
	publishing offers a meaningful alternative: immediate access to the latest research, free of charge 
	and with few limits on how the material is reused. We believe that medical research can and should be 
	disseminated as efficiently, effectively, and equitably as possible.

<h3>Do authors have to assign copyright to PLoS?</h3>
<p>
	No. It will be up to the authors to decide whether they wish to retain copyright or transfer copyright
	to their research institution or to PLoS. But no matter who owns the copyright, authors will be required 
	to grant users an irrevocable license to print, copy, or use the work in any lawful way, subject to the 
	condition that proper attribution is given whenever the work is reproduced or redistributed. Please 
	see our <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/license.html">licensing agreement</a> for more information 
	and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020025">this editorial</a> for a further explanation 
	of why we employ this copyright arrangement.
