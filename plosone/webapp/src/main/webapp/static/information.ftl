<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> is run as a partnership between its in-house PLoS staff and international <a href="edboard.php" title="PLoS ONE | Advisory and Editorial Boards">Advisory and Editorial Boards</a>, ensuring fast, fair, and professional peer review. To contact the Managing Editor, <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.html#csurridge" title="PLoS.org | Chris Surridge's Bio">Christopher Surridge</a>, or the Publications Assistant, <a href="http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.html#lking" title="PLoS.org | Lindsay King's Bio">Lindsay King</a>, please e-mail <strong>plosone [at] plos.org</strong>. </p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p><em>PLoS ONE</em> features reports of primary research from all disciplines within science and medicine. By not excluding papers on the basis of subject area, <em>PLoS ONE</em> facilitates the discovery of the connections between papers whether within or between disciplines. </p>
<h2>Peer Review</h2>
<p>Each submission will be assessed by a member of the <em>PLoS ONE</em> Editorial Board before publication. This pre-publication peer review will concentrate on technical rather than subjective concerns and may involve discussion with other members of the Editorial Board and/or the solicitation of formal reports from independent referees. If published, papers will be accompanied by comments from the handling Editorial Board member and will be made available for community-based open peer review involving online annotation, discussion, and rating. </p>

<h2>Open Access</h2>
<p>All works published in PLoS journals are open access, licensed under the <a href="license.php" title="Open Access Publishing & Creative Commons Attribution License">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. Everything is immediately available online without cost to anyone, anywhere&#8212;to read, download, redistribute, include in databases, and otherwise use&#8212;subject only to the condition that the original authorship is properly attributed. Copyright is retained by the author</p>

<h2>Publication Charges</h2>
<p>To provide open access, PLoS journals use a business model in which our expenses-including those of peer review, of production, and of online hosting and archiving-are recovered in part by a publication fee paid by the authors or research sponsors for each article they publish. Currently, this fee is US$1250, but there is a reduced rate of US$750 for papers submitted before the launch of the journal (<a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/model.html" title="PLoS.org: Publication Fees Model">read more about publication fees</a>). We also have a fee waiver policy for authors who do not have funds to cover publication fees. Editors and reviewers have no access to author payment information, and hence ability to pay will not influence publication decisions. These policies ensure that the fee is never a barrier to publication.</p>
