  This file is a template. It contains many configuration parameters you may want to change.
  However, there are even more configuration parameters that can be tuned. To get a list of
  all of these, see documentation. (Or, failing that, most defaults are configured in
  webapps at WEB-INF/classes/defaults.xml. Though it is possible that there are
  even more - see ConfigurationStore documentation.)
